    usage: |
      /generate <blocks> <interval>
      
      Blocks -  The amount of blocks in x and z direction you want to generate, for example:
      blocks = 2000 will generate to x=-2000, x=2000, z=-2000, z=2000
      
      Interval - Interval between teleports, in ticks. If you don't know what to put here, put 10. 
      If chunk loading can't keep up with you being teleported, set this to a higher value.
